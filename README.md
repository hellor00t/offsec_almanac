## OffSec Workflow

## How to Use

Workflows represent a general concept surrounding types of assessments. Workflows are meant to be the starting point for notes.

Each workflow will walkthrough steps or objectives of each engagement.

Example: General Workflow will take you from an IP/Domain into the next workflow depending on result

Folders are labeled as assessment objectives.  Within each objective are tools that can be used for that phase of the assesment. Where applicable subfolders are used to further categorize tools but not at the expense of folder depth/complexity.

Example: Recon folder will have tools for OSINT, Portscanning, webscraping etc

Specific tool usages are defined by tags.

Example: Nmap will have the tag #port_recon, #service_recon etc.
